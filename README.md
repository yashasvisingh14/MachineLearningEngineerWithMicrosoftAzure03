# Capstone Project - Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure
## Brief Overview of the Project
For this project, we have used a dataset external to the Azure ML ecosystem from Kaggle. It is supported by Azure ML's automl API. In this task, we will train our models on the dataset and deploy the best model. The binary classification model is trained using Logistic Regression algorithm. The automl.ipynb file trains the model using Automated ML and deploys the best model obtained as a webservice. On the other hand, the hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb file trains the model and perform hyperparameter tuning using HyperDrive. AutoML gives us the better accuracy than HyperDrive. 

## Project Set Up and Installation
In order to set up this project in AzureML, we have to first create a workspace in the Machine Learning Studio with our Azure Subscription. When creating a new workspace, you can either automatically create services needed by the workspace or use existing services. To know more about the multiple ways to set up go through this link.

## Dataset
### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
